# tiffany-kata-blackjack
The app is built base on the [Blackjack Kata](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/General_Developer/blob/main/katas/kata-foundational/foundational-kata-blackjack.md) requiremnts.

**There are 2 additional requirements:**
- If the player looses, player has chances to try again until he wins or he exits the game
- Second player (machine)- same playing rule as dealer

**The scoring game:**
1. If the player (you) has a higher score than everyone else (but less than 22), the player wins
2. If the player (you) has a lesser score than everyone else, player loses
3. If the player (you) goes over 21, player loses (bust)
4. If everyone else goes bust, player (you) wins
5. In the event of a tie:
   - If someone has blackjack, that person wins
   - If multiple people have blackjack, it's a tie
   - If no one has blackjack, it's a tie
In the scenario of a tie, the player doesn't "win" therefore he must play again.
